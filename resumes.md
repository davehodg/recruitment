# Resumes and CVs

You will certainly want to put a lot of effort into your CV because it is often the first thing people use to learn about you. 
Its aim should be to get you that interview - and maybe be something to talk about in the interview. 


Among the group we've seen a wide variety of CV styles. Dave's advice includes:

* Spellcheck it. I recommend grammarly.com.
* Have a pleasing format. Not just b/w.
* My two column system doesn't appear to confuse ATS systems.
* Consider an online CV creator. They have modern, subtly colourful styles.

Alex thought his spelling and grammar was good but grammarly.com actually helped a lot. 
Alex is a fan of black and white CVs, though. They are going to be printed out, so if you use colour make sure it is appropriate for your job.


# Online CV Tools

You probably have used a word processor of some kind for your CV and that is absolutely fine. 
However there are a number of online systems which let you enter the information for the CV and it generates the document in one of a number of formats. 
This is helpful if you want to produce different CVs for different job applications. 
The most popular at the moment seems to be resume.io This is not free, but seems to be reasonably priced.
