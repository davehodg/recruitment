# Recruitment and Hunting for Work in the UK and EU

This repository is meant to contain general advice for people seeking work in the UK and EU.
It has been first drafted based upon a series of conversations between 

* https://github.com/davehodg/ Dave Hodgkinson
* https://github.com/alexmc6/ Alex McLintock
* and several others who were far more helpful.

Although Dave and Alex are both developers and techies not everyone in the discussion is. 
Our advice may be aimed at techies, but it is not meant to solely focus on them. 

The discussions are private (though if you know Alex or Dave and are hunting for work then, please, get in touch). 

# NOTE

This collection of documents will be public, and so should not contain any personal or private information 

# CVs

A lot of discussion revolves around curriculum vitae (aka resumes) and how they can successfully get you an interview.

# LinkedIn

Love it or hate it, most of us find LinkedIn useful for networking and finding jobs/work to apply for. 
Here are some thoughts about LinkedIn

* [LinkedIn](linkedin.md)

# Workflow

Whatever you do when job hunting, create and stick to a system or process for your hunt. 
You will really benefit from a consistent workflow for finding suitable job ads, or leads, keeping track of those you have applied for, and so on. 

* [Workflows](create_workflow.md)

In general people find looking for work best in the morning, ideally each day. This means that they can see job ads before hundreds of people apply. 

# Networking

Do we have any advice on how to meet people in your field? 
The main thing I (Alex) learnt was to try to network with people senior to you. They are the ones who might be able to give you work. If you only network with people at the same level to you then you are trusting that they will introduce you to their manager later on. 

It has been said that most jobs are filled through personal contacts and not public job advertisements so it makes sense to network. 

The biggest problem with networking is that it can be hard to show results (either you got work or you didn't). remember this is for the long game. 
In particular you can carry on networking while you are in a job even if you have no intention of leaving. You might need it one day.

# Public Speaking

Alex recommends doing public speaking such as YouTube videos of different lengths. This can be

* Interviews/Podcasts as a guest (least amount of preparation and work)
* Lightning talks (5-10 minutes, several hours of preparation and practice) 
* Full blown training or even books. (most amount of preparation and work)

If you need to speak to real people and get immediate good advice the Toast Masters organisation has lots of local groups you can join. There is a subscription fee for this of (I think) 50 UKP per half year. (Check!)
