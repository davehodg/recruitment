# Recruitment and Hunting for Work in the UK and EU

This repository is meant to contain general advice for people seeking work in the UK and EU.
It has been first drafted based upon a series of conversations between 

* https://github.com/davehodg/ Dave Hodgkinson
* https://github.com/alexmc6/ Alex McLintock
* and several others who were far more helpful.

Although Dave and Alex are both developers and techies not everyone in the discussion is. 
Our advice may be aimed at techies, but it is not meant to solely focus on them. 

The discussions are private (though if you know Alex or Dave and are hunting for work then, please, get in touch). 

# NOTE

This collection of documents will be public, and so should not contain any personal or private information 

# CVs

A lot of discussion revolves around curriculum vitae (aka resumes) and how they can successfully get you an interview.

# Workflow

Whatever you do when job hunting it is probably best to create and stick to a system or process for your hunt. 
You need some kind of workflow for finding suitable job ads, or leads, keeping track of those you have applied for, and so on.
