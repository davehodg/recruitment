# Applicant Tracking Systems

More and more these days CVs are vetted by Applicant Tracking Systems to see if they match the job requirements. 
In many ways this is essential when thousands of people apply for a role.
Both recruiters and HR departments use them so it is work making sure your CV can be read by these systems correctly. 

There are ATS CV checking web site but these are usually a commercial service but not too expensive. 
(In our group Toni has an account and knows how to use it). 

An important point of this process is that it doesn't say the CV is good or bad, but says whether it is suitable for a particular job!
Vet your CV against what you're applying for at least once and make sure you're meeting the benchmark for the main categories.
