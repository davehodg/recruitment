# Workflow

You probably want to create your own procedure for job hunting that you can follow day in day out. 
A lot of the time this can be seen as a numbers game. 
You look for 20 vacancies or opportunities, apply for 5 and maybe 1 gets back to you.
Do that often enough and you should get interviews and eventually the work. 


Use something to keep track of progress. Suggestions are:

*  Salesforce. It's a sales pipeline after all. (does this have a free tier?)
* A spreadsheet. Have a column for CV read/interview/rejection.
* A project management tool. Have a story for each job in progress. Move across to done as it progresses.
* A Kanban/trello board. 


# Kanban or Trello Boards


This is a simple project management tool which has columns representing different task states. you move tasks between the columns as the state changes
For example I (Alex) has columns for "Deals" with the following columns:

 * Lead (similar to an advert or job vacancy)
 * In Progress (eg applied for)
 * Closed Success (I got the work!)
 * Closed Failed (I didn't get the work)


You can look at the "in progress" items and decide whether anyone needs a nudge. You can also look at the potentials and see what you think should be applied for. 
(This column might include companies you want to apply to)

trello.com is one of the most popular for this though others include Monday.com and the Kanban plugin for Obsidian.
